# basicmeshslicer
  
  Dependencies: numpy, numpy-stl, argparse
  
  Arguments:
  - a .stl file encoding a 3D quardilateral prism 
  - a .txt file containing information that respresents a plane:
      - first line: normal vector (x, y, z) of the plane
      - second line: a point (x, y, z) on the plane
      
  Assumptions:
  - the plane must split the prism into two parts in a way that each part contain either the original front face or back face
  
  Returns:
  - Two .stl prisms generated by the partitioning when the plane intersects the prism
